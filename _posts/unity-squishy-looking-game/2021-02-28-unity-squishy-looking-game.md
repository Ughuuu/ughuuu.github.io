So, as I previously said, I like to cook. A lot. So this is what our next game will be about, itâ€™s decided!
<br />
Madalina started painting some of the things we might need for the game:

<br />
Pretty, right?
<br />
For this we are using [Unity](https://unity.com/){:target="_blank"}. To begin with, I imported the vegetables into a scene, and it looked ok (but we can do better):

</video>

<br />
For the jelly look, I followed this amazing tutorial [How to Make Softbody Physics in Unity!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3avaX00MhYc){:target="_blank"} by [Highfly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFEbYRZrkvEfCAecEf0SPXg){:target="_blank"}.
<br />
Then, I added some lights after following the [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA){:target="_blank"} tutorial on [2D Lights in Unity!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkgGyO9VG54){:target="_blank"}.
<br />
And here is the current look:
