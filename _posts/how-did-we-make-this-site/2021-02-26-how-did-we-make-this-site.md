description: how this website was made using github pages and the klise theme

The website was made using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} and the [klisÃ©](https://github.com/piharpi/klise){:target="_blank"} minimalistic theme for [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll){:target="_blank"}.
<br />
I created it as a means to share hype around games me and Madalina might make.
<br />
I will post updates here regarding anything we are working on and also announce it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/appsinacup){:target="_blank"}.
