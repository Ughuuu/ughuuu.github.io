description: how we started working on our first game together

After I finished university, I stopped ordering food and started to cook a lot.
<br />
I started by cooking different types of egg dishes, then pasta, indian, etc:

My first goal was to cook food as diversified as possible and have it taste really well. I would look for recipes online, and the one best chef I followed was [Gordon Ramsay](https://www.gordonramsay.com/).
<br />

So, Madalina was drawing a lot lately, and we always thought we should make a game togheter, and wanted to be something that would be fun and we both liked to do. That's how we started work on a puzzle cooking game. We don't know much about it except that it's going to be a puzzle like game similar to [Cooking Mama](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.ofcr.cm00&hl=en_US&gl=US), the gameplay somehow similar to [Potion Craft](https://www.potioncraft.com/) and the graphics would be done with watercolors, scanned and imported into the game to see what kind of a look that gives to it.
