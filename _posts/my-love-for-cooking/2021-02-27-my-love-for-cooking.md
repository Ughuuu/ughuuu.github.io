description: how we started working on our first game together
---

After I finished univeristy, I stopped ordering food and started to cook a lot.
<br />
I started by cooking different types of egg dishes, then pasta, indian, etc.
<br />
My first goal was to cook food as diversified as possible and have it taste really well. I would look for recipes online, and the one best chef I followed was [Gordon Ramsay](https://www.gordonramsay.com/).
<br />
So, Madalina was drawing a lot lately, and we always thought we should make a game togheter, and wanted to be something that would be fun and we both liked to do.
